This subject involves the following:
- An introduction to robotics
- Transforms and DH Tables
- Introduction to motion planning, C - Space, RRT, PRM
- Introduction to computer vision and Kalman filters
- Introduction to AI, reinforcement learning

All the programming assignments were done in ROS (Indigo). Taught about 25 last semester students who learned robotic concepts while highly practicing them using ROS. 
Some of the final projects students did include (click the link to access the YouTube videos of the demonstrations):

- [Autonomous navigation using the ROS Navigation Stack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSypf14WUvg)
- [Shadow Motion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkP3A7bOTHU)
- [Tele-operated vehicle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ORvbwnbxhU)
- [Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance](https://youtu.be/z7xy2I1ssTU)
- [MineSweeper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbKJC3mvNU0&feature=youtu.be)
- [Drone with SLAM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_EQpaeoQSU)
- [Robo Piano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzVn2lYCRk)

All the projects were properly documented in Github and the students learned valuable skills that will help them pursue post-graduate education.
