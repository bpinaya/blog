All the topics covered were developed in ROS Indigo, some of the topics given where:
- An introduction to ROS nodes, topics, `catkin_make` and other build tools
- Rviz for topic visualization and Gazebo for simulation
- An introduction to Motion Planning with MoveIt
- ROS navigation stack and SLAM
- ROS perception stack with OpenCV and PCL
- A brief introduction to ROS industrial

All the programming assignments were done in ROS (Indigo). Taught about 25 last semester students who learned robotic concepts while highly practicing them using ROS. 
Some of the final projects students did include (click the link to access the YouTube videos of the demonstrations):

- [Autonomous navigation using the ROS Navigation Stack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSypf14WUvg)
- [Shadow Motion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkP3A7bOTHU)
- [Tele-operated vehicle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ORvbwnbxhU)
- [Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance](https://youtu.be/z7xy2I1ssTU)
- [MineSweeper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbKJC3mvNU0&feature=youtu.be)
- [Drone with SLAM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_EQpaeoQSU)
- [Robo Piano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEzVn2lYCRk)

All the projects were properly documented in Github and the students learned valuable skills that will help them pursue post-graduate education.
