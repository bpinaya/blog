# About me

I am a mechatronics engineer from UCB San Pablo. Thanks to a Fulbright scholarship I finished my master in Robotics at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester MA.

I've been part of robotics competitions like the Space Robotics Challenge by Nasa. Also former member of the WHRL (WPI Humanoid Robotics Laboratory). 

Due to my work I was named [Intel Student Ambassador](https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2017/05/01/benjamin-pinaya-mechatronics-engineer-roboticist-space-technology-enthusiast) and also Jetson Student Partner by Nvidia.

Currently I work as a Computer Vision Engineer at The Kobi Company in Leuven, Belgium. They have good belgian fries and beer over here, so I might stay for a bit.
